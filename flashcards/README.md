This plugin is a [flashcard software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flashcard_software) that uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) as a learning technique.

You can share the flash cards with other users of Hubzilla and ZAP.

Your learning progress will be kept private.

### In Praxis

The school and the students all have an account at Hubzilla or ZAP. The school has the Flashcards-Addon installed.

Everybody could have an account on differnt hubs:

- The school on https://school.com/
- A student on https://student.org/

The school has the addon installed at https://school.com/flashcards/school .

The school creates a box of flashcards "English-Italian" and possibly some more. The URL for "English-Italian" could be something like https://school.com/flashcards/school/xy12tlsel89q81o .

The student learns "English-Italian" by opening https://school.com/flashcards/school/xy12tlsel89q81o .

The school and the students can both change or add cards. The syncronization is done automatically as soon as they upload changes.

### Permissions and Technically

A student sees those flashcards only the school allows him to see. The student will get a copy of "English-Italian". For both users it looks the same, same URL, same content. Everything is done under the hood. The student does not own the flashcards. The school can withdraw the permissions for a student or even delete the flashcards at any time.
